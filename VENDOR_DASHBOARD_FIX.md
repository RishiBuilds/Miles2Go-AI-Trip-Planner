# Vendor Dashboard Fix - Show All Registered Vendors

## ✅ Issue Fixed

**Problem:** Vendors weren't showing in the dashboard after registration because the query was hardcoded to only show vendors from "Paris".

**Solution:** Updated the dashboard to show ALL vendors with an optional city filter.

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. Updated Query

**Before:**

```typescript
const vendors = useQuery(api.VendorSchema.GetVendorsByLocation, {
  city: "Paris", // Hardcoded!
});
```

**After:**

```typescript
const allVendors = useQuery(api.VendorSchema.GetAllVendors);

// Filter by city if needed
const vendors =
  selectedCity === "all"
    ? allVendors
    : allVendors?.filter((v) => v.location.city === selectedCity);
```

### 2. Added City Filter

- Dropdown to filter vendors by city
- Shows count for each city
- "All Cities" option to see everything
- Only appears when there are multiple cities

### 3. Enhanced Stats Banner

- Shows total vendor count
- Shows live occupancy rate
- Real-time updates indicator

### 4. Fixed Schema Issue

- Removed `rating` field conflict
- Now correctly uses `averageRating` in database

## 🎯 How It Works Now

1. **Register a Vendor**
   - Go to `/vendor-register`
   - Fill out the form (any city)
   - Submit registration

2. **View in Dashboard**
   - Go to `/vendors`
   - See ALL registered vendors
   - Filter by city if needed
   - View real-time pricing

3. **Manage Vendors**
   - See all your listings
   - Apply smart pricing
   - Track revenue
   - Monitor occupancy

## 🧪 Testing

   Vendor 3: New York, USA
   ```

2. **Check Dashboard**
   - Should see all 3 vendors
   - City filter shows: All Cities (3), Mumbai (1), Paris (1), New York (1)
   - Can filter to see specific city

3. **Verify Real-Time Updates**

## 🎨 UI Improvements

### After

## 📝 Additional Fixes

### Schema Validation

Fixed the `rating` vs `averageRating` conflict:

```typescript
// Now correctly destructures rating and uses averageRating
const { rating, ...vendorData } = args;
const vendorId = await ctx.db.insert("VendorTable", {
  ...vendorData,
  averageRating: rating || 0,
});
```
